# Copter Project

> This is my work (together with two other team members) during the third year, 2nd semester  control systems class.  The main objectives of this project were:
> 1. To learn how control systems by actually designing, implementing and testing a project.
> 2. To appreciate the control system principles/concepts taught in theoritical class.
> 3. To earn academic credits for our efforts in this work.

Project Implementation strategy.
---
- Acquiring component and implementing basic tests on them.
- Designing the copter mounting shaft.
- Controlling the brushless motor with a power source. 
- Designing an arduino code to control the rising of the propeller.

Components we used:
---
- Arduino Uno
- Brushless motor 
- Propellor
- Motor driver 
- Jumper cables (mostly male-female and male-male)
- Breadboard 
- Power supply Module 
- Toggle switch 
- LEDs (1 red, 1 blue, 1 yellow, 1 green)
- Potentiometer 


---
what was not done
---
